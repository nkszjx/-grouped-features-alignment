# grouped-features-alignment
To effectively address the domain shift problem on cross-satellite images, we develop a novel UDA method based on grouped features alignment (GFA) and entropy minimization (EM) to extract domain invariant representations to improve cloud detection accuracy of cross-satellite images.
